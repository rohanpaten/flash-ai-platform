## Known Issues & Solutions

### Resolved Issues:
✅ Success probability stuck at 45% - Fixed probability capping
✅ Models not loading - Replaced all placeholders

✅ Port 8000 blocked - Moved to port 8001
✅ Pattern integration - Fully implemented

### Current Limitations:
- Pattern models need full training (using profiles currently)
- Some hierarchical models fail to load (graceful fallback)
- Frontend doesn't display pattern insights yet
- Limited to 100 req/hour (rate limiting)

---

## Future Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities:
1. Train pattern-specific models with full dataset
2. Update frontend to display pattern insights
3. Implement pattern-based investor matching
4. Add pattern evolution tracking

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Real-time Learning**: Continuous model updates
2. **Global Expansion**: Multi-region support
3. **Investor Platform**: Pattern-based matching
4. **Success Playbooks**: Pattern-specific guidance
5. **API v3**: GraphQL support

### Research Directions:
- Transformer-based pattern recognition
- Causal inference for success factors
