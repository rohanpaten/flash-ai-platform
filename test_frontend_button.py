‚úÖ ANALYZE BUTTON FIX COMPLETE!
================================

The "Analyze Startup" button is now ALWAYS VISIBLE with clear status:

üìç WHEN SECTIONS ARE INCOMPLETE:
   - Button shows: "Analyze Startup (Disabled)"
   - Text shows: "Complete all sections to enable analysis (X/4 done)"
   - Button is grayed out (60% opacity)
   - Clicking shows alert with instructions

üìç WHEN ALL 4 SECTIONS ARE COMPLETE:
   - Button shows: "‚ú® Analyze Startup"
   - Button is fully enabled and blue
   - Clicking submits the form for analysis

üéØ TO TEST THE FIX:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Go to the data collection form
3. You'll see the "Analyze Startup (Disabled)" button immediately
4. Complete each section by:
   - Filling all fields
   - Clicking "Complete [Section Name]"
5. After 4 checkmarks, the button becomes enabled

üí° USER BENEFITS:
- No more "missing button" confusion
- Clear progress indication
- Immediate visibility of what needs to be done
- Better user experience

The frontend is now more user-friendly! üéâ
