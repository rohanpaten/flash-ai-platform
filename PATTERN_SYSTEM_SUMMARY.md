    3. Statistical matching (20% weight)
  - Multi-label classification support
  - Pattern evolution prediction
  - Gap analysis and recommendations

- **Features**:
  - Pattern confidence scoring
  - Secondary pattern detection
  - Success modifier calculation
  - Tag-based insights

### Week 2-3: Enhanced Orchestrator ✅

  - Extends existing orchestrator with pattern support
  - Pattern weight: 25% of final prediction
  - Combines base models with pattern insights
  - Dynamic confidence intervals based on pattern stability

- **Integration**:
  - Backward compatible with existing API
  - Pattern-based success modifiers
  - Enhanced explanations with pattern insights

### Week 3: Pattern Model Training ✅
- **Created**: `train_pattern_models.py`
  - Trains pattern-specific models for major patterns
  - Implements adaptive model selection based on sample size
  - Feature importance analysis per pattern
  - Cross-validation and performance evaluation

- **Created**: `train_pattern_system_simple.py`
  - Simplified training for quick integration
  - Pattern-aware feature engineering
  - Performance: ~81% AUC (improvement from 77%)

### Week 4: Enhanced API Server ✅
- **Created**: `api_server_v2.py`
  - Full production API with pattern support
  - New endpoints:
    - `/predict_enhanced` - Pattern-enriched predictions
    - `/patterns` - List all patterns
    - `/patterns/{name}` - Pattern details
    - `/analyze_pattern` - Pattern fit analysis
  - Maintains all existing endpoints

- **Features**:
  - Pattern analysis in predictions
  - Similar company recommendations
  - Pattern-specific risks and opportunities
  - Evolution path predictions

## Integration Components

### Configuration Files Created:
1. **`models/orchestrator_config.json`**
   - Enables pattern support

   - Configures model ensemble weights

2. **`models/pattern_profiles.json`**
   - Statistical profiles for 5 major patterns
   - CAMP score distributions
   - Success rates per pattern

3. **`models/pattern_evaluation.json`**
   - System performance: 81.2% AUC
   - Improvement over baseline: 5.3%
   - Pattern distribution in test set

4. **`models/pattern_training_summary.json`**
   - Training metrics for all patterns
   - Individual pattern AUC scores
   - Overall system performance

5. **`ml_core/discovered_patterns.json`**
   - Data-driven pattern discoveries
   - Cluster-based pattern profiles

## Key Achievements

### Performance Improvements:
- **Baseline AUC**: 77.1%
- **With Patterns**: 81.2%
- **Improvement**: +5.3%
- **Pattern Accuracy**: 73% average confidence

### Pattern Distribution (100k dataset):
- PEOPLE_DRIVEN: 29,288 (29.3%)
- MARKET_DRIVEN: 27,651 (27.7%)
- ADVANTAGE_DRIVEN: 19,925 (19.9%)
- CAPITAL_DRIVEN: 13,259 (13.3%)
- Named Patterns: 9,877 (9.9%)

### Technical Innovations:
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines pre-defined patterns with data-driven discovery
2. **Multi-label System**: Startups can have multiple pattern tags
3. **Evolution Tracking**: Predicts likely pattern transitions
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identifies what's needed to match better patterns
5. **Success Modifiers**: Adjusts predictions based on pattern fit

## API Usage Examples

### Enhanced Prediction:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/predict_enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"funding_stage": "series_a", "revenue_growth_rate_percent": 150, ...}'
```

### List Patterns:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/patterns
```

### Analyze Pattern Fit:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/analyze_pattern \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"metrics": {...}}'
```

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Train pattern-specific models using full dataset (currently using profiles)
2. Update frontend to display pattern insights
3. A/B test pattern vs non-pattern predictions
4. Monitor pattern distribution in production

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Dynamic Pattern Learning**: Continuously update patterns from new data
2. **Industry-Specific Patterns**: Deeper vertical-specific patterns
3. **Pattern Transitions**: Track actual evolution paths
4. **Investor Matching**: Match patterns to investor preferences
5. **Success Playbooks**: Pattern-specific growth strategies
